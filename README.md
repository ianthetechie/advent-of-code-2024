# Advent of Code 2024

These are my [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) solutions.
I'm pretty lazy and don't usually finish (I'll be traveling mid-month),
but maybe someone finds this interesting (a lot of people seem to post these repos these days).

Many years I like to pick a language theme.
I've done Advent of code nearly every year in some capacity but,
somehow, I've never done it in Rust (even though I've been writing Rust professionally for quite a while now)!
So this year I'm fixing that.

NOTE: It has come to my attention that the AoC organizers don't want us to distribute problem data,
so I've removed those from the repository.
